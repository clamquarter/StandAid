# StandAid

<h3>Summary</h3>

StandAid is an app I worked on during challenge 2 at the Apple Developer Academy. It's for people who live sedentary lifestyles--so, just about everyone. It all starts with standing up, so StandAid allows the user to schedule custom reminders to get up, go outside, strech, etc. It is similar to a feature built into the Apple Watch, except it works without an Apple Watch and allows full customization.
